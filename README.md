## Music visualization using multiple tracks

This is a visualization of multiple audio tracks playing simultaneously using [CreateJS](http://www.createjs.com/#!/CreateJS).

The code is pretty bad at this moment, lots of unused variables, but it works and is easy to understand.

You can see the live demo [here](http://www.rgaino.com/experiments/spaceshipsong/).
