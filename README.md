## Music visualization using multiple tracks

This is a visualization of multiple audio tracks playing simultaneously using WebAudio.
Recently Chrome has blocked auto-play audio and I haven't had the chance to update the code. I checked and it still works on Safari.

"Spaceship Song" by João Erbetta: https://soundcloud.com/joaoerbetta/spaceship-song

João was very kind to let give me the song in separate tracks. Under the folder audio you have all separate instruments, and the full song mp3 for reference.
