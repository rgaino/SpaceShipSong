## Music visualization using multiple tracks

This is a visualization of multiple audio tracks playing simultaneously using WebAudio.

"Spaceship Song" by João Erbetta: https://soundcloud.com/joaoerbetta/spaceship-song

João was very kind to let give me the song in separate tracks. Under the folder audio you have all separate instruments, and the full song mp3 for reference.
